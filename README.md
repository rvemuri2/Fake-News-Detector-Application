# Fake News Detector Application
 We used machine learning and Figma to design an application that can tell if an article/news is fake news based on the title and the text in the body. This application was awarded 3rd place at HackMerced VI and ended in almost a virtual tie to second place, only losing by 0.5 points. The team consisted of Rohit Vemuri(me), Bharadwaj Satyanarayana, Karthik Gnanakumar, and Akheel Shaik. For the machine learning, we used Jupyter Notebook. For the front end, we used figma.
